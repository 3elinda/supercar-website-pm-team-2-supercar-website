          <h2>OUR ORIGIN STORY</h2>
          <p>
            Richard Patterson (Rich), CEO & CTO of Trion Supercars, realized a
            lifelong dream in May 2012 after 40 years in the automotive industry
            by founding Trion with a core team of experts. <br /><br />
            Rich's passion for cars started in his Detroit childhood, and at 15,
            he earned a GM apprenticeship after winning a statewide drafting
            contest. A graduate of Mumford High School and Hall of Fame
            inductee, Rich began his career as a CAD designer at Modern
            Engineering, quickly rising to leadership roles due to his expertise
            in automotive interior systems.
            <br /><br />
            With over two decades of experience, including contributions to
            Chrysler's Stow 'n Go seating system, Rich moved to the West Coast
            to immerse himself in design innovation. Today, he brings his vision
            to life with Trion Supercars, offering high-performance
            American-made supercars that combine style, speeds of 300 mph, and
            comfort, with options ranging from traditional engines to hybrid and
            fully electric models.
